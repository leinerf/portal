I choose a json object or dictionary so that I can separate the events, start dates, and end dates with key value pairs. This was to make the data structure easy to read and understand. In my algorithm I used date time to compare the dates start and end times. This was so that i can tell if there was conflict. I know theres conflict if the second start time was before the first start time and the end time of the first start time was greater than the start time of the second one. Afterwards i check if their start and end time are the same and if they are then theres conflict. lastly i check if the start time of one is after the start time of the other but the end time of the first one is greater than the other.
